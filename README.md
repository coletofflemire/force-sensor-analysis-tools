This repository contains a series of MATLAB scripts and GUI's used in conjunction with an Arduino Mega and capacitive force sensors.  

Mounted on a helmet in specific locations specified in the code, the pressure sensor values are plotted on a 3D surface to visualize the data. 

Further analysis of the data can be done within the spreadsheets generated. 

These files require the Arduino Hardware Support Library on MATLAB.
